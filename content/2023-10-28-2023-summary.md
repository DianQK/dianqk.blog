# Summary

This year marks my first continuous involvement in open-source contributions. I've fixed numerous mis-compilation, added missing optimizations, and included LTO, debugging info, built-in functions, WebAssembly, and even an issue with Apple Silicon.

**During this journey, I was fortunate to receive numerous invaluable help, especially from those who reviewed my pull requests. Thank everyone very much. (●´∀｀●)**

Highlight:
- Resolving a long-standing issue causing debugging info corruption under LTO.
- Adding the crate for built-in functions to LTO in Rust, addressing another long-standing issue.
- Adopting the English name "Quentin Dian" for better communication.

I've categorized my contributions using these emojis:
- 💢 Mis-compilation
- 🍻 Missing optimization
- ℹ️ Debugging info
- 🦀 Rust-related
- 🐉 LLVM-related
- 🐦 Swift-related
- 🍎 Apple-related

# Rust

Commit history: [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=DianQK&since=2023-01-01&until=2023-12-31](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=DianQK&since=2023-01-01&until=2023-12-31).

Apart from simple pull requests like updating test cases, my contributions mainly revolved around built-ins and LTO:

1. [Add the `no-builtins` attribute to functions when `no_builtins` is applied at the crate level. #113716](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113716)
2. [Restore `#![no_builtins]` crates participation in LTO. #113923](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113923)
3. [Add thinlto support to codegen, assembly and coverage tests #118036](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118036)
4. [Avoid adding builtin functions to `symbols.o` #118568](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118568)

Despite addressing many issues during this process, unfortunately, there are still some [known issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/118609) that need resolution. I'll submit MCP once these issues are resolved.

# Ruslin

I use Joplin for note-taking, but I don't want Joplin's Android client. Hence, I developed a compatible client: [ruslin-android](https://github.com/ruslin-note/ruslin-android). I apologize for the lack of recent updates. I plan to adjust my spare time next year. I'm also considering desktop development.

# Other Projects

# Personal Details

DianQK is just a casual Chinese pseudonym formed from the pinyin abbreviation of "靛(dian)" and "青(qing)", where "靛青" refers to indigo. It has led to confusion about how to call me. To resolve this, I asked ChatGPT for a name: Quentin Dian. So, you can call me Dian or dianqk.

I switched entirely from Arch Linux to NixOS, a fantastic operating system where I can manage everything with code.

To enhance my efficiency, I also purchased a GPD handheld console. I complete most of the code above using the GPD during my subway commutes. I assembled a machine with a 7950X processor, cutting my local build time in half. I can now complete a full compile in just a few minutes. I also bought a Mac Mini (M2) to test issues on that platform.
